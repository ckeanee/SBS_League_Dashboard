# Single entry ("directory",) -> {player_id: {name, position, nfl_team}} built from every
# roster seen this season. A dropped player is a free agent by the time you'd look them up,
# so this can't be resolved from any league's *current* roster — it has to be assembled from
# roster snapshots as they were fetched over the season.

# Keyed by NFL week -> {team_abbr: "pre" | "in" | "post"}. Short TTL since this is what
# drives the live "pending/live/finished" matchup indicator — it needs to flip promptly
# as real games kick off and end, unlike the mostly-static fantasy data above.
