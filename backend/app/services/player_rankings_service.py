    The same real NFL player is often independently rostered in more than one of the

    points for a given week are the same regardless of which league's roster you read
    them from — so summing across every (league, week) a player appears in would
    inflate anyone rostered in multiple leagues. Instead this keeps one points value
    per (player, week) and sums those, giving each player's true season total once.
