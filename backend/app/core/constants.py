# ESPN scoring statId -> the abbreviation ESPN's own "Scoring Breakdown" boxscore view
# uses for it (e.g. 84 -> "FGA"). ESPN doesn't expose this mapping in any API response —
# it's baked into their frontend JS — so this was reverse-engineered by cross-referencing
# this league's own scoringSettings.scoringItems (statId -> points-per-occurrence) and
# real players' appliedStats against ESPN's own displayed Scoring Breakdown page for the
# same games, matching column totals until every statId we've actually seen resolved
# unambiguously. Covers every statId observed in this league's boxscores through week 3;
# an id not in this map just won't get a labeled line (never silently mislabeled).
